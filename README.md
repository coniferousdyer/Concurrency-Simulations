# Concurrency Simulations

Concurrency using threads is an important aspect of operating systems and networks. The following two examples demonstrate the ideas of multi-threaded programming: synchronizing multiple threads using mutex locks, condition variables and semaphores, and basic networking concepts, by simulating real-life scenarios and using threads to perform accurate simulations of these scenarios.

## 1. Course Allocation Portal

Sanchirat and Pratrey, students of a college, have been asked to use their skills to design an unconventional course registration system for the college, where a student can take trial classes of a course and can withdraw and opt for a different course if he/she does not like the course. Different labs in the college have been asked to provide
students who can act as course TA mentors temporarily and take trial tutorials.

## 2. Multithreaded Client and Server

Here, we create a basic simulation of a scenario wherein multiple clients make requests to a single server. This simulation runs on your local machine.

The specific details of the logic and implementation, as well as instructions to set up the programs, have been elaborated upon in the respective directories (`REPORT.md`).
